The organism's brains consists of tiny neural networks that evolve overtime for survival. The parameters for the controller neural network brains are part of the genome data that is passed through reproduction. The inspiration behind the program is based on simpsons' [Tree House of Horror VII](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VII).

## Installation

To compile the program, you can run the make file. Note that the SFML library is required to run GUI. In addition, having openmp will also improve the performance.
