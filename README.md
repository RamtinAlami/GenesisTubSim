# GenesisTubSim

#### A C++ program that simulates simple evolving organisms is a randomly generated world.

The organism's brains consists of tiny neural networks that evolve overtime for survival. The parameters for the controller neural network brains are part of the genome data that is passed through reproduction. The inspiration behind the program is based on simpsons' [Tree House of Horror VII](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VII).

Please note that the SFML library is required to run the program. In addition, having openmp will also improve the performance.
